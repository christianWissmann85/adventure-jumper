# Adventure Jumper Documentation Consolidation Action Plan

## Overview

Your documentation shows impressive depth and quality, but it's spread across 100+ files making it difficult to maintain and navigate. This plan will help you consolidate your valuable content into a manageable structure while preserving all essential information.

## Current State Analysis

- **100+ documentation files** across 7 major categories
- **High-quality content** with detailed technical specifications
- **Over-documentation** for a solo hobby project
- **Enterprise-style structure** that's hard to maintain
- **Cross-references everywhere** making consolidation tricky

## Target State

- **8-12 core documents** maximum
- **Easy navigation** and maintenance
- **All essential information preserved**
- **Quick reference capability**
- **Future-proof structure**

---

## Phase 1: Create Core Consolidated Documents

### 1.1 Create `GAME_DESIGN.md` (Consolidate 01_Game_Design/)

**Merge these into ONE document:**

- Current GDD.md (keep as main structure)
- All Mechanics/ files â†’ add as sections
- Characters/ files â†’ add as appendix sections
- Narrative/ files â†’ add as story section
- Worlds/ files â†’ add as world section
- UI_UX_Design/ â†’ add as UI section

**New structure:**

```markdown
# Adventure Jumper - Game Design Document

## 1. Game Overview (from current GDD.md)

## 2. Core Mechanics

### 2.1 Aether System (from AetherSystem_Design.md)

### 2.2 Combat System (from CombatSystem_Design.md)

### 2.3 Movement System (from other mechanics)

## 3. Characters & Story

### 3.1 Main Character (from Characters/01-main-character.md)

### 3.2 Supporting Cast (merge allies, enemies, NPCs)

### 3.3 Story Outline (from Narrative/)

## 4. World Design (from Worlds/)

## 5. UI/UX Design (from UI_UX_Design/)

## Appendix: Reference Tables & Quick Stats
```

### 1.2 Create `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` (Consolidate 02_Technical_Design/)

**Merge these key documents:**

- SystemsReference.md (keep as main structure)
- ComponentsReference.md â†’ add as major section
- Architecture.md â†’ add as overview section
- Most important TDD files â†’ add as appendices

**New structure:**

```markdown
# Adventure Jumper - Technical Architecture

## 1. System Architecture Overview

## 2. Entity-Component-System Design

## 3. Core Systems Reference

### 3.1 Physics & Movement

### 3.2 Input & Player Control

### 3.3 Audio & Visual Effects

### 3.4 Save & Data Management

## 4. Components Reference

## 5. Key Implementation Details

### 5.1 Aether System Implementation

### 5.2 Combat System Implementation

### 5.3 Physics Integration

## Appendix: Technical Notes & Decisions
```

### 1.3 Create `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` (Consolidate 03_Development_Process/)

**Keep only essential development info:**

```markdown
# Adventure Jumper - Development Guide

## 1. Getting Started

- Setup instructions
- Build process
- Testing approach

## 2. Code Standards

- Style guidelines (from 05_Style_Guides/)
- Best practices

## 3. Asset Pipeline

- How to add new assets
- Audio guidelines
- Art style notes

## 4. Release Process

- How to build releases
- Testing checklist
```

---

## Phase 2: Archive & Cleanup

### 2.1 Create Archive Directory

```bash
mkdir docs/archive
mv docs/01_Game_Design docs/archive/
mv docs/02_Technical_Design docs/archive/
mv docs/03_Development_Process docs/archive/
mv docs/05_Style_Guides docs/archive/
```

### 2.2 Keep Minimal Active Documentation

**Preserve these as-is:**

- `docs/README.md` (update with new structure)
- `docs/Terminology_Glossary.md` (keep for reference)
- `docs/04_Project_Management/` (keep recent sprints only)
- `docs/06_Player_Facing_Documentation/` (if still relevant)

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Everything

```bash
# Create a backup branch
git checkout -b docs-consolidation-backup
git add -A && git commit -m "Backup before docs consolidation"
git checkout main
```

### Step 2: Create New Core Documents

1. **Start with GAME_DESIGN.md**

   - Copy GDD.md as base
   - Add mechanics sections from Mechanics/ folder
   - Add character info from Characters/ folder
   - Add narrative elements
   - Add world descriptions

2. **Create TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md**

   - Copy SystemsReference.md as base
   - Add ComponentsReference.md content
   - Add key TDD information (focus on Aether, Combat, Physics)
   - Add architecture overview

3. **Create DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**
   - Extract setup info from current docs
   - Add essential style guidelines
   - Add asset creation workflow
   - Add testing approach

### Step 3: Update Cross-References

- Update all internal links to point to new consolidated docs
- Update README.md to reference new structure
- Update project-structure.md to reflect new docs organization

### Step 4: Archive Old Structure

- Move old directories to archive/
- Keep archive accessible for reference but out of main docs

---

## Phase 4: New Directory Structure

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md (updated navigation)
â”œâ”€â”€ GAME_DESIGN.md (consolidates 01_Game_Design/)
â”œâ”€â”€ TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md (consolidates 02_Technical_Design/)
â”œâ”€â”€ DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md (consolidates 03_Development_Process/ + 05_Style_Guides/)
â”œâ”€â”€ Terminology_Glossary.md (keep as-is)
â”œâ”€â”€ 04_Project_Management/ (keep recent items only)
â”œâ”€â”€ 06_Player_Facing_Documentation/ (if still relevant)
â””â”€â”€ archive/ (all old structure for reference)
    â”œâ”€â”€ 01_Game_Design/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 02_Technical_Design/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 03_Development_Process/
    â””â”€â”€ 05_Style_Guides/
```

---

## Expected Outcome

**Before:** 100+ files across 7 directories
**After:** 3-5 core documents + archive for reference

**Benefits:**

- âœ… Quick navigation and reference
- âœ… Easy to maintain and update
- âœ… All essential information preserved
- âœ… Still professional but not overwhelming
- âœ… Perfect for onboarding (including future you!)

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours of focused work

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Use markdown table of contents** for easy navigation in long docs
2. **Keep the archive** - don't delete anything, just move it
3. **Do this in chunks** - consolidate one section at a time
4. **Test the new structure** by trying to find specific information
5. **Update project-structure.md** after completion to reflect the new organization

This approach preserves your excellent work while making it actually usable for a hobby project! ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š
