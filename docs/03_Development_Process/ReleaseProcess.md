## 1. Release Types

### 1.1 Major Releases
- New game versions with significant feature additions
- Version number format: X.0.0 (e.g., 2.0.0)

## 2. Release Planning

### 2.1 Release Schedule
- Annual roadmap defines major and feature releases
- Quarterly planning refines specific content for upcoming releases
- Monthly review adjusts maintenance update schedules
- Release calendar maintained by the Producer

### 2.2 Feature Lockdown
For each release:
1. **Feature Proposal**: Features proposed for inclusion
2. **Scope Assessment**: Engineering estimates and risk analysis
3. **Feature Freeze**: No new features after this milestone (typically 4 weeks before release)
4. **Code Freeze**: Only bug fixes allowed (typically 2 weeks before release)
5. **Release Candidate**: Final build for verification (typically 1 week before release)

### 2.3 Release Criteria
A release is ready when:
- All must-have features are complete
- No known critical or high-severity bugs
- Performance meets target metrics
- All platforms pass certification requirements
- Localization is complete for supported languages
- Release approval from key stakeholders is obtained

## 3. Branch and Build Management

### 3.1 Branching Strategy
We follow this branching pattern:
- `main`: Always represents the latest released version
- `develop`: Integration branch for upcoming release
- `release/X.Y.Z`: Created when preparing specific release
- `feature/*`: For new feature development
- `bugfix/*`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: For emergency fixes to production

### 3.2 Version Control Workflow
For standard releases:
1. Create release branch from `develop`
2. Only bug fixes merged to release branch
3. When release is complete, merge to `main` and tag
4. Merge `main` back to `develop`

For hotfixes:
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement and test the fix
3. Merge to `main` and tag
4. Merge `main` back to `develop`

### 3.3 Build Generation
- Builds are generated through automated CI/CD pipeline
- Version numbers automatically applied based on branch
- Build artifacts stored in secure repository
- Build metadata includes Git hash, build date, and configuration

## 4. Testing Process

### 4.1 Testing Phases
Each release undergoes these testing phases:

1. **Feature Testing**: Validates new features as they're completed
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensures components work together
3. **Regression Testing**: Verifies existing functionality remains intact
4. **Performance Testing**: Benchmarks performance across target devices
5. **Platform Certification**: Tests compliance with platform requirements
6. **Release Candidate Testing**: Final verification of production build

### 4.2 Testing Environments
We maintain multiple testing environments:
- **Development**: For daily testing during feature development
- **Staging**: Mirrors production for pre-release testing
- **Beta**: Limited external testing environment
- **Production**: Live environment

### 4.3 Automated Testing
Our automated tests include:
- Unit tests (required to pass for all builds)
- Integration tests (required to pass for release candidates)
- Performance benchmarks (required to meet thresholds)
- Platform compatibility tests (required to pass on all target platforms)
