## 1. Bug Reporting

### 1.1 Bug Report Channels

Bugs can be reported through several channels:

- **Internal Testing**: Bugs found by QA team and developers
- **Playtesting Sessions**: Bugs found during structured playtesting
- **Beta Testing Program**: Bugs reported by external beta testers
- **Production Monitoring**: Bugs detected through crash reports and analytics
- **Player Feedback**: Bugs reported by players after release

### 1.2 Bug Report Requirements

All bug reports should include:

- **Title**: Clear, concise description of the issue
- **Environment**: Platform, OS version, device specifications, game version
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Numbered steps to consistently trigger the bug
- **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
- **Severity Assessment**: Initial assessment of impact (see section 2.2)
- **Frequency**: How often the bug occurs (always, sometimes, rarely)
- **Supporting Materials**: Screenshots, videos, save files, logs

### 1.3 Initial Screening

When a bug is first reported:

1. **Verification**: QA team attempts to reproduce the bug
2. **Deduplication**: Check if this is a duplicate of an existing bug
3. **Completeness**: Ensure all required information is provided
4. **Initial Assessment**: Preliminary evaluation of severity and priority

## 2. Bug Classification

### 2.1 Bug Categories

Bugs are categorized by affected area:

- **Gameplay**: Issues affecting core mechanics
- **Graphics**: Visual glitches, rendering issues
- **Audio**: Sound problems, music issues
- **UI/UX**: Interface functionality or usability problems
- **Performance**: Frame rate drops, loading times, memory issues
- **Stability**: Crashes, freezes, soft locks
- **Saving/Loading**: Issues with game state persistence
- **Localization**: Text or translation problems
- **Networking**: Multiplayer or online service issues
- **Platform-specific**: Issues only occurring on specific platforms

### 2.2 Severity Levels

We use five severity levels:

1. **Critical**:
   - Game crashes or becomes unplayable
   - Player progress is lost or corrupted
   - Blocker for game functionality
   - Security vulnerabilities

2. **High**:
   - Major feature is broken
   - Significant negative impact on player experience
   - Causes frequent frustration
   - Workarounds are difficult or non-obvious

3. **Medium**:
   - Feature works but with limitations
   - Noticeable but not game-breaking issues
   - Reasonable workarounds exist
   - Affects secondary gameplay elements

4. **Low**:
   - Minor visual or audio glitches
   - Edge case scenarios
   - Minimal impact on player experience
   - Easy workarounds available

5. **Cosmetic**:
   - Purely visual issues with no gameplay impact
   - Text formatting or minor UI alignment issues
   - Non-essential polish items

### 2.3 Priority Levels

Priority determines the order in which bugs are addressed:

1. **Immediate**: Fix required ASAP, possibly warranting a hotfix
2. **High**: Should be fixed in the next release
3. **Normal**: Should be fixed in an upcoming release
4. **Low**: Can be deferred to a later release if necessary
5. **Backlog**: Will be addressed when time allows

## 3. Triage Process

### 3.1 Triage Meeting

Bug triage meetings occur:
- **Daily**: For critical issues during active development
- **Weekly**: For regular bug review and prioritization
- **Post-Release**: Special triage sessions after major releases

### 3.2 Triage Team

The triage team consists of:
- **Producer** or Project Manager (meeting lead)
- **Lead Developer** (technical assessment)
- **QA Lead** (reproduction verification)
- **Game Designer** (gameplay impact assessment)
- **Additional specialists** as needed

### 3.3 Triage Workflow

During triage, the team:

1. Reviews new bugs
2. Confirms severity assessment
3. Assigns priority level
4. Determines target release
5. Assigns bugs to appropriate developers
6. Reviews long-standing bugs for reprioritization

### 3.4 Decision Criteria

Prioritization decisions are based on:

- **Player Impact**: How many players are affected and how severely
- **Business Impact**: Effect on revenue, retention, or reputation
- **Technical Risk**: Complexity of fix and potential for regressions
- **Resource Requirements**: Time and effort needed to fix
- **Dependency Chain**: Whether other features depend on this fix

## 4. Bug Lifecycle

### 4.1 Status Workflow

Bugs follow this lifecycle:

1. **New**: Initially reported, not yet verified
2. **Verified**: Confirmed by QA
3. **In Progress**: Developer actively working on fix
4. **Fixed**: Developer has implemented a solution
5. **In Testing**: QA verifying the fix
6. **Closed**: Bug has been resolved
7. **Reopened**: Fix was insufficient or caused regression

### 4.2 Resolution Types

When closing a bug, one of these resolutions is assigned:

- **Fixed**: Issue was addressed and verified
- **Won't Fix**: Intentional decision not to address the issue
- **Duplicate**: Already reported in another bug
- **Cannot Reproduce**: Unable to consistently trigger the issue
- **Not a Bug**: Working as designed or expected behavior
- **Obsolete**: Feature removed or redesigned, making bug irrelevant

### 4.3 Documentation Requirements

For each bug fix:

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Document what caused the bug
- **Fix Description**: Explain how it was fixed
- **Test Cases**: Document how to verify the fix
- **Related Bugs**: Link to any related issues
- **Regression Risks**: Note potential side effects

## 5. Bug Fix Implementation

### 5.1 Development Guidelines

When implementing bug fixes:

- Create a dedicated branch for each bug fix
- Write tests that reproduce the bug
- Ensure fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- Consider platform-specific variations
- Minimize changes to reduce regression risk
- Follow [Implementation Guide](ImplementationGuide.md) standards

### 5.2 Code Review

Bug fix code reviews have special considerations:

- Verify the fix doesn't introduce regressions
- Ensure fix works across all affected platforms
- Check for similar patterns elsewhere in code
- Consider performance implications
- See [Code Review Process](CodeReviewProcess.md) for details

### 5.3 Testing Requirements

All bug fixes undergo:

- Specific test case for the reported bug
- Regression testing for related functionality
- Performance testing if relevant
- Platform-specific testing if applicable

## 6. Communication and Reporting

### 6.1 Internal Reporting

Bug status is communicated through:

- Daily standup meetings
- Weekly status reports
- Bug tracking system dashboards
- Cross-functional team meetings

### 6.2 External Communication

For player-facing bugs:

- **Known Issues List**: Public document of acknowledged bugs
- **Release Notes**: Detail fixed bugs in each release
- **Community Updates**: Communicate status of high-visibility issues
- **Support Responses**: Templates for responding to reported issues

### 6.3 Metrics and Analysis

We track these metrics to improve our process:

- Bug detection rate (by phase)
- Mean time to fix
- Regression rate
- Fix effectiveness rate
- Bug clustering analysis

## 7. Special Cases

### 7.1 Hotfix Process

For critical bugs requiring immediate fixes:

1. Expedited triage and assignment
2. Simplified approval process
3. Abbreviated testing focused on the issue and critical functionality
4. Emergency release procedure activation

### 7.2 Platform-Specific Issues

For platform-specific bugs:

1. Coordinate with platform partners if needed
2. Consider platform certification requirements
3. Test thoroughly on all affected configurations
4. Document platform-specific workarounds

### 7.3 Live Service Issues

For bugs affecting online services:

1. Assess immediate mitigation options
2. Consider server-side fixes vs. client updates
3. Evaluate player compensation needs
4. Document incident timeline and resolution

## 8. Continuous Improvement

### 8.1 Bug Prevention Strategies

To reduce bug occurrence:

- Static code analysis integration
- Automated testing expansion
- Code review focus areas based on bug patterns
- Developer education on common bug sources

### 8.2 Process Improvement

The triage process is improved through:

- Quarterly retrospectives
- Analysis of bug metrics and trends
- Team feedback collection
- Industry best practice adoption
