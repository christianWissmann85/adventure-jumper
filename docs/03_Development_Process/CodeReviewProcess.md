## 1. Code Review Principles

### 1.1 Purpose of Code Reviews
Code reviews serve several important purposes in our development process:

- **Quality Assurance**: Identify bugs, logic errors, and edge cases
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread domain knowledge and coding techniques among the team
- **Standards Adherence**: Ensure code follows project standards and conventions
- **Design Feedback**: Evaluate and improve the design of code changes
- **Documentation**: Verify that code is properly documented

### 1.2 Core Values
Our code review process is guided by these core values:

- **Respect**: Focus on the code, not the person
- **Collaboration**: Reviews are a conversation, not a judgment
- **Learning**: Every review is an opportunity for both reviewer and author to learn
- **Efficiency**: Reviews should be timely and focused

## 2. Code Review Process

### 2.1 Pre-Review Checklist for Authors

Before submitting code for review, ensure your changes:

- [x] Implement the required functionality
- [x] Include appropriate tests
- [x] Pass all existing tests and linting
- [x] Follow the [Code Style Guide](../05_Style_Guides/CodeStyle.md)
- [x] Include documentation updates if necessary
- [x] Remove debug code, commented-out code, and TODOs where possible
- [x] Break large changes into smaller, reviewable pieces

### 2.2 Review Request Process

1. **Create pull request** in GitHub:
   - Use the provided pull request template
   - Add a clear title that summarizes the change
   - Include detailed description of changes
   - Link related issues or tasks
   
2. **Assign reviewers**:
   - At least one primary reviewer (domain expert)
   - At least one secondary reviewer (fresh perspective)
   - Consider including a junior developer for knowledge sharing

3. **Run automated checks**:
   - CI pipeline should trigger automatically
   - Ensure all automated tests pass
   - Verify code coverage meets requirements
   - Check that static analysis tools show no new issues

### 2.3 Reviewer Responsibilities

When reviewing code, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the context**:
   - Read the pull request description and linked issues
   - Understand what problem the code is solving
   - Consider alternative approaches

2. **Review the code**:
   - Check code logic and correctness
   - Verify test coverage and test quality
   - Evaluate code organization and architecture
   - Consider performance implications
   - Ensure documentation is adequate

3. **Provide feedback**:
   - Use constructive language
   - Be specific about what needs to change
   - Explain why changes are needed
   - Distinguish between required changes and suggestions
   - Provide examples where helpful

### 2.4 Author Response

When receiving feedback:

1. Respond to all comments
2. Ask questions if feedback is unclear
3. Explain your reasoning when necessary
4. Make requested changes or discuss alternatives
5. Mark resolved comments as resolved

### 2.5 Review Resolution

The review process concludes when:

1. All required changes have been addressed
2. At least one required reviewer approves the changes
3. CI checks pass

## 3. Review Standards

### 3.1 What to Look For

#### Functionality
- Does the code do what it's supposed to?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Is error handling appropriate?

#### Maintainability
- Is the code clearly written and easy to understand?
- Are functions and methods appropriately sized?
- Is there any duplication that could be eliminated?
- Are object-oriented principles followed correctly?

#### Performance
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Are appropriate data structures used?
- Are there concerns about memory usage or leaks?

#### Security
- Are there potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are credentials or sensitive data handled properly?

#### Testing
- Are tests comprehensive?
- Do tests cover edge cases?
- Are tests clear and maintainable?

### 3.2 Comment Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines or sections
- **Provide context**: Explain why something is an issue
- **Suggest solutions**: When possible, offer an improvement
- **Link to resources**: Reference documentation or examples
- **Prioritize issues**: Indicate severity when appropriate

### 3.3 When to Approve

Approve a pull request when:

- All critical issues have been addressed
- Code meets quality standards
- Required functionality is implemented correctly
- Tests are adequate

It's acceptable to approve with minor comments for small items that can be addressed in follow-up work.

## 4. Special Review Types

### 4.1 Architecture Reviews

For significant architectural changes:

1. Schedule a dedicated architecture review meeting
2. Prepare documentation explaining the proposed architecture
3. Include broader team in the review process
4. Consider long-term implications

### 4.2 Performance-Critical Reviews

For performance-critical code:

1. Include performance metrics in the PR
2. Consider requesting benchmarks
3. Review for algorithmic efficiency
4. Consider different load scenarios

### 4.3 Expedited Reviews

For urgent changes (e.g., critical bug fixes):

1. Clearly mark PR as urgent
2. Ping reviewers directly
3. Focus review on correctness and risk assessment
4. Consider trade-offs between speed and thoroughness

## 5. Tools and Automation

Our code review process is supported by:

- **GitHub Pull Requests**: Primary platform for code reviews
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated checks
- **Flutter Analyze**: Static analysis for Flutter/Dart code
- **Dart Format**: Automatic code formatting
- **Code Coverage Reports**: Integrated into PRs

## 6. Measuring Review Effectiveness

We track these metrics to ensure our review process is effective:

- **Time to review**: Average time from PR submission to first review
- **Review iterations**: Average number of review rounds per PR
- **Defect detection**: Bugs found during review vs. after merge
- **Reviewer load**: Distribution of reviews across the team

## 7. Common Code Review Comments

To maintain consistency, use these standard comments for common issues:

- **"Consider adding a test for this edge case..."**
- **"This would benefit from additional documentation..."**
- **"This could be simplified by..."**
- **"This might cause performance issues because..."**
- **"According to our style guide, we should..."**

## 8. Continuous Improvement

Our code review process evolves based on:

1. Quarterly retrospectives on the review process
2. Anonymous feedback surveys
3. Analysis of review metrics
4. Industry best practices

Changes to the process are documented and communicated to the entire team.
