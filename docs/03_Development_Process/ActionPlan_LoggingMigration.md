# Action Plan: Migrating from `print()` to Structured Logging

This plan outlines the steps to replace `print()` calls in the Adventure Jumper project with `developer.log()` for temporary debugging and the `logging` package (via `GameLogger`) for more permanent and structured logging.

## Phase 0: Preparation & Understanding

1.  **Understand the Tools:**

    - **`print()`**: Simple, direct output to console. Discouraged in production code (`avoid_print` lint).
    - **`developer.log()`**: Part of `dart:developer`. Better for debugging, integrates with DevTools, allows naming and severity levels. Good for temporary debug messages you intend to remove.
    - **`package:logging`**: A powerful, configurable logging framework. Allows different log levels (SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST), named loggers, and custom output handlers. Your `GameLogger` class already provides a nice wrapper around this.

2.  **Review `GameLogger.dart`:**

    - Familiarize yourself with `- [ ] lib/src/utils/logger.dart`.
    - It provides `GameLogger.getLogger(String name)` and an extension `object.logger`.
    - `GameLogger.initialize()` sets up the root logger, levels, and how records are handled (including routing to `ErrorHandler` for `SEVERE` and `developer.log` for `WARNING`).

3.  **Ensure `GameLogger` is Initialized:**

    - In your `main.dart` file (or equivalent entry point for your game), ensure `GameLogger.initialize()` is called early.

      ```dart
      // In your main.dart (or similar)
      import 'package:adventure_jumper/src/utils/logger.dart';
      import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart'; // For kDebugMode

      void main() {
        // ... other setup ...
        GameLogger.initialize(
          enableVerboseLogging: kDebugMode, // More logs in debug, less in release
          rootLevel: kDebugMode ? Level.ALL : Level.INFO,
        );
        // ... rest of your app initialization ...
      }
      ```

## Phase 1: Quick Wins - `print()` to `developer.log()`

This phase targets `print()` statements used for _temporary, active debugging_ that you'd typically remove once an issue is resolved or a feature is stable.

1.  **Identify Temporary Debug Prints:**

    - Search your codebase for `print(` calls.
    - Identify those that are purely for your immediate debugging needs (e.g., checking a variable's value at a specific point, confirming a code path is hit).

2.  **Replace with `developer.log()`:**

    - Import `dart:developer`:
      ```dart
      import 'dart:developer' as developer;
      ```
    - Change `print("My debug message: $variable");` to:
      ```dart
      developer.log(
        "My debug message: $variable",
        name: 'YourClassName.methodName', // Provides context in DevTools
        level: 800, // INFO level (see developer.log levels)
      );
      ```
    - **Example from `PlayerController`:**

      ```diff
      // Before
      print('Player moving left (velocity: ${player.physics?.velocity.x ?? 0})');

      // After (in PlayerController.dart)
      import 'dart:developer' as developer;
      // ...
      developer.log(
        'Player moving left (velocity: ${player.physics?.velocity.x ?? 0})',
        name: 'PlayerController._movePlayerLeft',
      );
      ```

3.  **Benefits:**

    - Better integration with Flutter DevTools (logs appear in the Logging view with names and levels).
    - Less likely to be accidentally committed if you make it a habit to remove them after debugging.

4.  **Clean Up:**
    - Once the specific debugging task is complete, **remove these `developer.log()` calls**. They are not meant for permanent logging.

## Phase 2: Migrating to `GameLogger` (Structured Logging)

This phase targets `print()` statements that represent more permanent logging needs â€“ things you might want to see in debug builds, or important warnings/errors that should always be logged.

1.  **Identify Persistent Log Candidates:**

    - Go through your `print()` calls again.
    - Which ones represent:
      - Significant game events (e.g., level start, player death)?
      - Warnings about potentially problematic states?
      - Errors or exceptions being caught and printed?
      - Detailed flow information that's useful for tracing complex logic (even in debug builds)?

2.  **Using `GameLogger`:**

    - For each class/file where you need logging:

      - You can use the `LoggerExtension` provided in `GameLogger.dart`:

        ```dart
        // Inside any class
        // No need for a separate Logger instance if you use the extension.
        // this.logger will give you a logger named after the class.

        // Example:
        // this.logger.info('An informational message.');
        // this.logger.warning('Something to be cautious about.');
        ```

      - Or, create a static logger instance if preferred (though the extension is often cleaner):

        ```dart
        import 'package:logging/logging.dart';
        import 'package:adventure_jumper/src/utils/logger.dart'; // For GameLogger

        class MyClass {
          static final _log = GameLogger.getLogger('MyClass');
          // OR using the extension:
          // this.logger.info(...);

          void myMethod() {
            _log.info('My method was called.');
            // or
            // logger.info('My method was called.');
          }
        }
        ```

3.  **Replace `print()` with Appropriate Log Levels:**

    - **Errors/Exceptions:**
      - `print("ERROR: Something went wrong: $e \n$stackTrace");`
      - becomes:
        ```dart
        // Using the extension:
        logger.severe('Something went wrong', e, stackTrace);
        // Or with a static logger:
        // _log.severe('Something went wrong', e, stackTrace);
        ```
        _(Your `GameLogger` will route this to `ErrorHandler.logError`)_
    - **Warnings:**
      - `print("WARNING: Suspicious value: $value");`
      - becomes:
        ```dart
        logger.warning('Suspicious value: $value');
        ```
        _(Your `GameLogger` will route this to `developer.log` with a warning level)_
    - **Informational Messages:**
      - `print("Player landed on platform.");`
      - becomes:
        ```dart
        logger.info('Player landed on platform.');
        ```
    - **Detailed Debug/Trace Messages (for complex logic you want to trace in debug builds):**
      - `print("PhysicsSystem: Resolving collision between A and B");`
      - becomes:
        ```dart
        logger.fine('Resolving collision between A and B');
        // Or for even more detail:
        // logger.finer('Detailed step in collision resolution...');
        // logger.finest('Most granular detail...');
        ```
        _(These will only show if `GameLogger.initialize` is set to `Level.ALL` or `Level.FINE`, etc., typically in `kDebugMode`)_

4.  **Examples:**

    - **`PhysicsSystem.dart` (debug prints for collision):**

      ```dart
      // Before:
      // print('RESOLVE COLLISIONS: Found ${_collisions.length} collisions');

      // After (using the logger extension):
      // At the top of the file, or ensure GameLogger.dart is imported.
      // No need for `static final _log = ...` if using the extension.

      // Inside a method of PhysicsSystem:
      logger.fine('RESOLVE COLLISIONS: Found ${_collisions.length} collisions');
      logger.finer( // Finer for more detailed steps
        'RESOLVING COLLISION: ${collision.entityA.type} vs ${collision.entityB.type}',
      );
      ```

    - **`AudioSystem.dart` (error prints):**

      ```dart
      // Before:
      // print('Error playing sound $soundId: $e');

      // After (using the logger extension):
      logger.severe('Error playing sound $soundId', e, someStackTraceIfAvailable);
      // If no stack trace is available, or it's not critical enough for ErrorHandler:
      // logger.warning('Failed to play sound $soundId: $e');
      ```

## Phase 3: Iteration and Refinement

1.  **Systematic Replacement:**

    - Go file by file or module by module.
    - Use your IDE's search functionality to find all `print(`.
    - For each `print()`, decide:
      - Is it temporary debug? -> `developer.log()` (and plan to remove).
      - Is it a persistent log? -> `logger.level()` (choose appropriate level).
    - Run `dart analyze` regularly. It will flag any remaining `print()` calls with the `avoid_print` lint.

2.  **Test Your Logging:**

    - Run your game in debug mode.
    - Check the VS Code Debug Console or Flutter DevTools Logging tab.
    - Verify that messages appear as expected with correct levels and context.
    - Test in release mode (or simulate it by changing `GameLogger.initialize` parameters) to see what logs are filtered out.

3.  **Review Log Levels:**
    - Are you using levels consistently?
    - Is there too much noise at the `INFO` level? Maybe some messages should be `FINE`.
    - Are all actual errors logged as `SEVERE`?

## Phase 4: Best Practices

- **Be Specific with Logger Names:** The `LoggerExtension` (e.g., `this.logger`) automatically uses the class name, which is great. If creating loggers manually, use descriptive names (e.g., `Logger('PhysicsSystem')`, `Logger('AudioSystem.Music')`).
- **Log Key Events:** Log important lifecycle events, state changes, and user interactions if they are crucial for understanding application flow or debugging.
- **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Never log passwords, API keys, personal user data, etc.
- **Performance:** While `package:logging` is efficient, avoid excessive logging in performance-critical loops. The level-based filtering helps mitigate this.
- **Context is Key:** Log enough information to understand the context of the message. `developer.log`'s `name` parameter and `package:logging`'s logger names help here. Include relevant variable values.

By following this plan, you'll significantly improve your project's maintainability and debuggability! Good luck!
