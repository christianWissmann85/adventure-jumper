## 1. CI/CD Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Our CI/CD pipeline serves to:
- Automate build and test processes
- Provide rapid feedback on code changes
- Ensure consistent build quality
- Streamline deployment to test and production environments
- Reduce manual errors in the release process

### 1.2 CI/CD Workflow
The general workflow is:
1. Developer commits code to branch
2. CI system automatically builds and tests the change
3. On successful build, deployment to appropriate environment
4. Feedback provided to developer and team
5. Metrics collected for process improvement

### 1.3 Core Principles
- **Automation First**: Minimize manual steps
- **Fail Fast**: Identify issues as early as possible
- **Build Once, Deploy Many**: Build artifacts used across environments
- **Visibility**: Transparent process with clear status reporting
- **Self-Service**: Developers can manage their own builds and deployments

## 2. Infrastructure

### 2.1 CI/CD Tools
Our infrastructure is built on:
- **GitHub Actions**: Primary CI/CD pipeline
- **GitHub Packages**: Artifact storage
- **Firebase App Distribution**: Beta version distribution
- **Fastlane**: Mobile app deployment automation
- **Docker**: Containerized build environments

### 2.2 Environments
We maintain several environments:
- **Development**: For continuous integration and feature testing
- **Staging**: Pre-release environment for QA and integration testing
- **Beta**: Limited public access for external feedback
- **Production**: Live player-facing environment

### 2.3 Infrastructure as Code
- All CI/CD configuration stored in version control
- Environment configurations managed through code
- Infrastructure changes follow same review process as app code

## 3. Build Pipeline

### 3.1 Triggered Events
Builds are triggered by:
- Push to any branch (limited pipeline)
- Pull request creation or update (full pipeline)
- Scheduled nightly builds (extended pipeline)
- Manual trigger (configurable pipeline)
- Release tag creation (release pipeline)

### 3.2 Build Steps
Each build goes through these phases:
1. **Checkout**: Retrieve source code
2. **Environment Setup**: Prepare build environment
3. **Dependencies**: Install and cache dependencies
4. **Compilation**: Compile code for target platforms
5. **Unit Testing**: Run fast unit tests
6. **Static Analysis**: Run linters and code quality tools
7. **Asset Processing**: Process game assets
8. **Integration Testing**: Run integration tests
9. **Packaging**: Create deployable artifacts
10. **Reporting**: Generate build reports

### 3.3 Build Matrix
We build across multiple configurations:
- Platform (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Web)
- Build type (Debug, Release, Profile)
- Architecture (ARM64, x86_64)

### 3.4 Artifact Management
Build artifacts are:
- Uniquely identified with build number and git hash
- Stored in GitHub Packages
- Retained based on branch type (longer for main/develop)
- Accessible to authorized team members
- Immutable once created

## 4. Testing in CI

### 4.1 Automated Test Suite
Our CI runs these test types:
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components
- **Widget Tests**: Testing UI components
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interaction
- **Performance Tests**: Measuring key performance indicators
- **Screenshot Tests**: Visual regression testing

### 4.2 Test Configuration
Tests run with:
- Coverage reporting enabled
- Parallelization where possible
- Timeout limits to catch infinite loops
- Consistent test environments through containerization
- Deterministic behavior (fixed seeds for random operations)

### 4.3 Quality Gates
Code must pass these quality gates:
- All tests passing
- Code coverage above threshold (currently 80%)
- No critical or high static analysis issues
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- No security vulnerabilities detected

## 5. Deployment Pipeline

### 5.1 Deployment Triggers
Deployments are triggered by:
- Successful build on develop branch (to development environment)
- Successful build on release branch (to staging environment)
- Manual approval (to beta environment)
- Release tag (to production environment)

### 5.2 Deployment Steps
Each deployment includes:
1. **Environment Preparation**: Configure target environment
2. **Artifact Retrieval**: Fetch build artifacts
3. **Configuration Injection**: Apply environment-specific settings
4. **Database Migrations**: Apply schema changes if needed
5. **Deployment**: Install application to environment
6. **Smoke Tests**: Verify basic functionality
7. **Health Checks**: Confirm system health
8. **Rollback Preparation**: Ensure rollback path if needed

### 5.3 Deployment Strategies
We employ different strategies based on environment:
- **Development**: Direct deployment
- **Staging**: Blue/green deployment
- **Beta**: Phased rollout to testers
- **Production**: Canary deployment (gradual rollout)

### 5.4 Post-Deployment Verification
After deployment, we automatically:
- Run smoke test suite
- Verify key user journeys
- Check error rates and performance
- Validate third-party integrations

## 6. Monitoring and Feedback

### 6.1 Build Status Reporting
Build status is communicated via:
- GitHub status checks
- Slack notifications
- Email alerts for failures
- Dashboard displays in office
- Daily summary reports

### 6.2 Build Metrics
We track these CI metrics:
- Build success rate
- Build duration
- Test coverage trends
- Number of flaky tests
- Code quality trends

### 6.3 Production Monitoring
Deployed applications are monitored for:
- Crash rates
- Performance metrics
- User engagement
- Error rates
- Server health (if applicable)

### 6.4 Feedback Loops
Monitoring data is used to:

- Trigger manual builds for testing

### 8.2 Pull Request Process
The CI-integrated pull request process:
1. Create feature branch
2. Push changes and create PR
3. CI automatically builds and tests
4. Results reported directly in PR
5. Failed checks block merging
6. Successful builds enable preview environments

### 8.3 Troubleshooting Builds
When builds fail:
1. Detailed logs available in GitHub Actions
2. Build artifacts accessible for debugging
3. Local reproduction steps documented
4. Common failures and solutions in knowledge base

## 9. Security and Compliance

### 9.1 Secrets Management
Sensitive information is managed by:
- GitHub Secrets for CI variables
