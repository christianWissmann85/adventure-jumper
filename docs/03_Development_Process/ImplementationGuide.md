# Implementation Guide - Adventure Jumper

*This document provides guidelines for implementing features in the Adventure Jumper project. It should be used in conjunction with our [Code Style Guide](../05_Style_Guides/CodeStyle.md) and the relevant technical design documents in the [TDD directory](../02_Technical_Design/TDD).*

## 1. Development Environment
### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Visual Studio Code with Flutter extension
- Git for version control

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Launch with `flutter run -d windows`

## 2. Code Style
### Naming Conventions
- Variables: `camelCase`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Files: `snake_case`

*For complete code style guidelines, refer to our [Code Style Guide](../05_Style_Guides/CodeStyle.md).*

### Code Organization
- Feature-based directory structure
- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle

## 3. Version Control
### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/`: New features
- `bugfix/`: Bug fixes

### Commit Guidelines
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues where applicable
- Keep commits focused on single changes

## 4. Project Structure
```
lib/
├── game/                  # Core game functionality
│   ├── components/        # Reusable game components
│   ├── entities/          # Game entities (player, enemies, etc.)
│   ├── systems/           # Game systems (physics, combat, etc.)
│   └── worlds/            # Level and world definitions
├── ui/                    # User interface components
│   ├── screens/           # Game screens (menu, game, etc.)
│   ├── widgets/           # Reusable UI widgets
│   └── theme/             # UI themes and styling
├── services/              # Service layer (audio, storage, etc.)
├── utils/                 # Utility functions and helpers
└── main.dart              # Entry point
```

## 5. Implementation Patterns

### Entity-Component System
- Components store data
- Systems process entities with specific components
- Favor composition over inheritance

### Dependency Injection
- Use GetIt for service location
- Register services at startup
- Test with mock implementations

### State Management
- Use Flame's built-in state management when possible
- Consider BLoC for complex UI states
- Keep game state and UI state separate

## 6. Performance Guidelines
- Optimize sprite batch rendering
- Use object pooling for frequent creation/destruction
- Profile regularly with Flutter DevTools
- Target 60 FPS on reference hardware

## 7. Testing
- Unit tests for game logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for game flow
- Manual testing for gameplay feel

## 8. Adding New Features
1. Create new branch from `develop`
2. Update related documentation
3. Implement feature with tests
4. Submit pull request with description
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge after approval

## 9. Debugging
- Use Flutter DevTools for performance profiling
- Enable console logging in development
- Implement debug visualization modes
- Use `assert` statements liberally in development

## 10. Common Issues and Solutions
- **Black screen on startup**: Check asset paths and loading
- **Input not registering**: Verify input system initialization
- **Memory leaks**: Ensure proper disposal of controllers and streams
- **Rendering glitches**: Check z-order and camera configuration
