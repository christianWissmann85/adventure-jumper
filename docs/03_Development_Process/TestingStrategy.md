# Testing Strategy - Adventure Jumper

*This document outlines the testing approach for the Adventure Jumper project. It should be used in conjunction with our [Code Style Guide](../05_Style_Guides/CodeStyle.md) and the [Implementation Guide](ImplementationGuide.md).*

## 1. Testing Approach
### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Focus on business logic

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow
- Test API contracts

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete game flows
- Validate user journeys
- Test on multiple devices

## 2. Test Categories
### Functional Testing
- Game mechanics
- User interface
- Input handling
- Save/load functionality

### Performance Testing
- Frame rate analysis
- Memory usage
- Load times
- Stress testing

### Compatibility Testing
- Different devices and screen sizes
- OS versions
- Input methods (keyboard, touch, controller)

### Localization Testing
- Text display in different languages
- Cultural appropriateness
- UI layout with different text lengths

## 3. Test Automation

### Unit Test Framework
- Flutter's built-in test framework
- Mockito for mocking dependencies
- Code coverage reporting with lcov

```dart
// Example unit test
void main() {
  group('Player movement tests', () {
    late Player player;
    late MockPhysicsSystem physics;
    
    setUp(() {
      physics = MockPhysicsSystem();
      player = Player(physics: physics);
    });
    
    test('Player moves right when right input is pressed', () {
      // Arrange
      final input = PlayerInput(right: true);
      
      // Act
      player.update(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(player.velocity.x, greaterThan(0));
    });
    
    test('Player jumps when jump input is pressed', () {
      // Arrange
      final input = PlayerInput(jump: true);
      player.isGrounded = true;
      
      // Act
      player.update(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(player.velocity.y, lessThan(0));
    });
  });
}
```

### Integration Tests
- Flutter integration_test package
- Test widgets and game components together
- Simulate user interactions

```dart
// Example integration test
void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  testWidgets('Player can collect items', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build the game
    await tester.pumpWidget(AdventureJumperGame());
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Find player and item
    final player = find.byType(PlayerEntity);
    final item = find.byType(CollectibleItem).first;
    
    // Move player to item
    await tester.drag(player, item.hitTestPoint - player.hitTestPoint);
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Verify item was collected
    expect(find.byType(CollectibleItem), findsOneWidget);  // One less than before
    expect(find.text('Items: 1'), findsOneWidget);  // Counter updated
  });
}
```

### Automated Playtesting
- Custom bot system for gameplay simulation
- Record and replay user sessions
- Stress testing with multiple simulated players

## 4. Manual Testing

### Playtesting Sessions
- Internal team playtests (weekly)
- Closed beta testing (monthly)
- Usability testing with new players
- Expert review sessions

### Test Cases
- Documented test cases for critical gameplay paths
- Edge case scenarios
- Error handling and recovery
- Accessibility testing

### Bug Reporting Workflow
1. Bug identification
2. Reproduction steps documentation
3. Severity and priority assignment
4. Assignment to developer
5. Fix implementation
6. Verification testing
7. Regression testing

## 5. Performance Testing

### Benchmark Tests
- Frame rate testing under different scenarios
- Memory usage monitoring
- Load time measurements
- Battery consumption analysis

### Tools
- Flutter DevTools for profiling
- Custom performance logging
- Device Farm for multi-device testing

### Performance Requirements
- 60 FPS during standard gameplay
- <2 second load times for levels
- <100MB memory usage
- No frame drops during transitions

## 6. Testing Environment

### Development Testing
- Developer machines
- Basic smoke tests before commits
- Pull request validation

### Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions automated build and test
- Test reports and notifications
- Nightly builds with extended tests

### Test Devices
- Low-end reference device (minimum specs)
- Medium-tier reference device
- High-end reference device
- Various screen sizes and aspect ratios

## 7. Test Documentation

### Test Plans
- Overall testing strategy
- Test coverage goals
- Resource allocation

### Test Cases
- Detailed test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results
- Pass/fail status

### Test Reports
- Test execution summary
- Defects found
- Coverage metrics
- Recommendations

## 8. Bug Tracking

### Bug Lifecycle
1. New
2. Assigned
3. Fixed
4. Verification
5. Closed/Reopened

### Bug Prioritization
- **P0**: Blocker - Must fix immediately
- **P1**: Critical - Must fix before release
- **P2**: Major - Should fix before release
- **P3**: Minor - Fix if time permits
- **P4**: Trivial - May be deferred

## 9. Release Testing
