## Overview
*Building Systems That Serve the Vision*

Adventure Jumper's architecture is designed around the core philosophy of **fluid, expressive gameplay** that makes players feel increasingly powerful and connected to the world. Every system decision is evaluated against our Design Pillars: Fluid & Expressive Movement, Engaging & Dynamic Combat, and Progressive Mastery.

> **Design Cohesion Integration**: This architecture directly implements the technical foundation needed to support Kael's journey of mastering Jumper abilities while uncovering the truth about the Great Fracture. Each system component is designed to enhance the player's sense of growing power and world connection.

## Design Pillars Integration

### Fluid & Expressive Movement Architecture
Our component-system architecture prioritizes:
- **Responsive Input**: Direct input-to-action mapping with minimal frame delay
- **Composable Abilities**: Movement abilities that build naturally on each other
- **Physics Consistency**: Predictable physics that enable skillful play
- **State Preservation**: Smooth transitions between movement states

### Engaging & Dynamic Combat Integration  
Combat systems are built to:
- **Integrate with Movement**: Combat abilities enhance rather than interrupt movement flow
- **Support Creativity**: Multiple valid approaches to encounters
- **Provide Clear Feedback**: Immediate visual and audio confirmation of actions
- **Scale with Skill**: Depth that rewards player mastery

### Progressive Mastery Support
The architecture enables:
- **Ability Evolution**: Systems that grow more complex as abilities unlock
- **Contextual Complexity**: Advanced features emerge naturally from basic interactions
- **Player Expression**: Technical framework for diverse play styles
- **Consistent Growth**: Each new ability feels like a natural extension

# Adventure Jumper - Architecture Overview

## High-Level Architecture

Adventure Jumper is built using the Flame game engine on top of Flutter, following a hybrid architecture that combines Entity-Component-System (ECS) patterns with traditional game object hierarchies.

### Minimum Viable Class Definitions for Sprint 1

Each scaffolded class should include:
1. **Class declaration** with appropriate inheritance/mixins
2. **Constructor** with basic parameter validation
3. **Essential properties** as placeholders
4. **Core method signatures** without full implementation
5. **TODO comments** indicating Sprint 2+ implementation areas
6. **Documentation comments** explaining class purpose

Example class template:
```dart
/// [Description of class purpose and responsibilities]
/// 
/// Planned features for future sprints:
/// - [Feature 1]
/// - [Feature 2]
class ExampleClass extends BaseClass with RequiredMixin {
  // Essential properties
  final String id;
  bool _isInitialized = false;
  
  /// Constructor with validation
  ExampleClass({required this.id}) {
    assert(id.isNotEmpty, 'ID cannot be empty');
  }
  
  /// Core method signatures
  Future<void> initialize() async {
    // TODO: Implement in Sprint 2
    _isInitialized = true;
  }
  
  void update(double dt) {
    // TODO: Implement core update logic in Sprint 2
  }
  
  void dispose() {
    // TODO: Implement cleanup in Sprint 2
    _isInitialized = false;
  }
}
```

### Integration Points for Sprint 1

**Critical Integration Requirements:**
1. All classes must compile without errors
2. Main game loop should instantiate core systems
3. Player entity should respond to basic input
4. Basic level should load with placeholder assets
5. Debug logging should be functional throughout

### Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] All 60+ classes compile successfully
- [ ] Main game runs without crashes
- [ ] Player character displays on screen
- [ ] Basic movement responds to keyboard input
- [ ] Level loads with placeholder background
- [ ] Debug console shows system initialization logs

### Sprint 1 File Count Summary
**Expected Scaffolded Files:** ~65 core class files across 11 modules
- **Game Module:** 4 files
- **Player Module:** 5 files  
- **Entities Module:** 6 files
- **Components Module:** 10 files
- **Systems Module:** 9 files
- **World Module:** 6 files
- **UI Module:** 6 files
- **Audio Module:** 5 files
- **Assets Module:** 5 files

**Total Directory Structure:** 11 primary modules + subdirectories as needed

This comprehensive scaffolding ensures that the "walking skeleton" architecture is fully established, allowing all subsequent sprint work to build upon a solid, well-organized foundation that supports the game's modular design and component-based architecture.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow Flutter/Dart code style guidelines
- Use dependency injection for system coupling
- Implement unit tests for critical systems
- Document all public APIs and components
