## Sprint-Aligned Development Approach

Adventure Jumper's technical design follows a **sprint-based implementation strategy** that ensures all systems are developed in alignment with our Design Cohesion principles. Each sprint delivers functional, tested components that contribute to the overall player experience vision.

### Sprint 1 Foundation (Current)
The architectural scaffolding defined in [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) provides the foundation for **65+ class files across 11 core modules**, designed to support:
- **Fluid Movement**: Component architecture enabling smooth, responsive player control
- **System Integration**: Clean interfaces between movement, combat, and progression systems  
- **Progressive Complexity**: Foundation that supports increasingly sophisticated abilities

### Implementation Validation Framework
Every technical implementation is validated against our Design Cohesion principles:
- Does this technical approach enhance the sense of **Fluid & Expressive Movement**?
- Will this system support **Engaging & Dynamic Combat** as abilities expand?
- Does the architecture enable **Progressive Mastery** throughout Kael's journey?

### Sprint Progression Timeline
- **Sprint 1-3**: Core architecture and movement foundation
- **Sprint 4-6**: Combat system integration and basic abilities
- **Sprint 7-9**: Advanced abilities and world-specific mechanics
- **Sprint 10+**: Polish, optimization, and user experience refinement

This directory contains all technical design documentation for Adventure Jumper, including architecture, specifications, and technical design documents (TDDs).

## Core Technical Documents

- [Architecture](Architecture.md) - High-level architecture of the game systems
- [Systems Reference](SystemsReference.md) - Detailed documentation of system classes
- [Components Reference](ComponentsReference.md) - Reference for game object components
- [Asset Pipeline](AssetPipeline.md) - Documentation for the asset creation workflow
- [Level Format](LevelFormat.md) - Specification for level files
- [Save Game Format](SaveGameFormat.md) - Specification for the save game system

## Technical Design Documents (TDDs)

Detailed technical specifications for individual systems can be found in the [TDD](TDD/) directory:

- [System Architecture TDD](TDD/SystemArchitecture.TDD.md) - Overall technical architecture
- [Player Character TDD](TDD/PlayerCharacter.TDD.md) - Character controller implementation
- [Combat System TDD](TDD/CombatSystem.TDD.md) - Combat mechanics implementation
- [Aether System TDD](TDD/AetherSystem.TDD.md) - Energy system implementation

## Relationship to Game Design

These technical documents implement the game design concepts described in the [Game Design](../01_Game_Design/) section. Primary connections include:

### Character Implementation
- [PlayerCharacter.TDD](TDD/PlayerCharacter.TDD.md) → [Main Character Design](../01_Game_Design/Characters/01-main-character.md)
- [EnemyAI.TDD](TDD/EnemyAI.TDD.md) → [Enemies Design](../01_Game_Design/Characters/03-enemies.md)

### World Systems
- [LevelManagement.TDD](TDD/LevelManagement.TDD.md) → [World Connections](../01_Game_Design/Worlds/00-World-Connections.md)
- [GravitySystem.TDD](TDD/GravitySystem.TDD.md) → [World Mechanics](../01_Game_Design/Worlds/06-puzzles-mechanics.md)

### Core Game Mechanics
- [AetherSystem.TDD](TDD/AetherSystem.TDD.md) → [Aether Design](../01_Game_Design/Mechanics/AetherSystem_Design.md)
- [TimeManipulation.TDD](TDD/TimeManipulation.TDD.md) → [Time Mechanics](../01_Game_Design/Mechanics/CoreGameplayLoop.md)

## Using This Section

The Technical Design Documentation section serves as the bridge between game design intentions and actual implementation. Each technical document defines how gameplay systems are implemented and provides guidance for developers working on the codebase.

## Development Process Integration

These documents connect to the development workflow as described in:
- [Implementation Guide](../03_Development_Process/ImplementationGuide.md)
- [Testing Strategy](../03_Development_Process/TestingStrategy.md)
- [Version Control Workflow](../03_Development_Process/VersionControl.md)

## Style Guidelines

All code implementations should follow:
- [Code Style Guide](../05_Style_Guides/CodeStyle.md)
- [Documentation Style](../05_Style_Guides/DocumentationStyle.md)

## Responsible Team

The Technical Design documentation is primarily maintained by:
- Lead Developer
- Systems Programmers
- Technical Designers

All technical changes should be reviewed by the Lead Developer to ensure system integrity and performance.
