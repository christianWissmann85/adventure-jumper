# Physics-Movement System Refactor Action Plan

## Executive Summary

This action plan outlines the comprehensive refactoring effort required to resolve the critical physics degradation issue identified in [Critical Report: Physics Movement System Degradation](../07_Reports/Critical_Report_Physics_Movement_System_Degradation.md). The refactor addresses fundamental architectural issues caused by missing technical specifications and system integration conflicts.

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 Sprints  
**Impact**: All movement and physics-dependent systems  
**Risk Level**: HIGH - Core gameplay functionality

## 1. High-Level Overview

### Root Cause

- Missing TDD documentation for PhysicsSystem and MovementSystem
- Overlapping system responsibilities (both systems modify entity positions)
- Lack of formal integration patterns between physics and movement
- Accumulating physics values causing progressive movement degradation

### Major Impact Areas

1. **Core Systems** - Physics, Movement, Input, Collision
2. **Game Components** - Player, Enemies, Platforms, Projectiles
3. **Test Suite** - Unit tests, Integration tests, Live environment tests
4. **Documentation** - TDDs, System References, Architecture docs
5. **Sprint Planning** - Current sprint goals need revision

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Movement remains fluid and responsive throughout gameplay
- [ ] No physics value accumulation or degradation over time
- [ ] Clear system boundaries with no responsibility overlap
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all refactored systems
- [ ] Complete and accurate technical documentation

## 2. Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Documentation & Design (Sprint 3 - Week 1)

### Phase 5: Documentation Consolidation (Sprint 4 - Week 3)

**Goal**: Update all project documentation to reflect new architecture

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Update all TDD documents with new patterns
- [ ] Revise System References documentation
- [ ] Analyse and review all existing Documentation, consider consolidating into less documents
- [ ] Consider trimming overall Documentation Suite, this is a hobby project, not a professional commercial product
- [ ] Update Architecture documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide for developers
- [ ] Update debugging procedures

#### Deliverables:

- Fully updated technical documentation
- Clear migration and debugging guides

### Phase 6: Validation & Polish (Sprint 5 - Week 1)

**Goal**: Ensure system stability and performance

#### Tasks:

- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Extended playtesting for physics stability
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention
- [ ] Final integration testing
- [ ] Bug fixing and polish

#### Deliverables:

- Stable, performant physics-movement system
- Validated gameplay experience

## 3. Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Breaking Existing Functionality**

   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
   - Rollback strategy: Version control checkpoints

2. **Performance Degradation**

   - Mitigation: Performance benchmarks before/after
   - Monitoring: Real-time performance profiling

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Incremental refactoring approach
   - Validation: Continuous integration testing

### Dependencies

- All gameplay features depend on movement system
- Level design may need adjustment for new physics
- AI systems may require updates for new movement patterns

## 4. Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- **Lead Developer**: Architecture and core system refactor
- **Physics Developer**: Physics system specialization
- **QA Engineer**: Test suite development and validation
- **Technical Writer**: Documentation updates

### Time Estimates

- Phase 1: 5 days (Documentation & Design)
- Phase 2: 10 days (Core System Refactor)
- Phase 3: 5 days (Component Updates)
- Phase 4: 5 days (Test Suite)
- Phase 5: 3 days (Documentation)
- Phase 6: 2 days (Validation)
- **Total**: 30 days (6 weeks)

## 5. Sprint Plan Revision

### Current Sprint (Sprint 2) Adjustment

- Freeze new feature development
- Focus on critical bug investigation
- Prepare for refactor in Sprint 3

### Sprint 3-5 Reallocation

- Dedicate to physics-movement refactor
- Postpone planned features:
  - Enemy AI (move to Sprint 6)
  - Power-ups (move to Sprint 6)
  - Advanced level design (move to Sprint 7)

## 6. Communication Plan
