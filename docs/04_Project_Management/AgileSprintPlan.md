# Adventure Jumper - Agile Sprint Plan

## üìã Document Overview

This document breaks down the Adventure Jumper development into granular, trackable tasks organized by sprint. Each sprint is divided into microversions with specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and dependencies. This plan is a living document and will be updated at the beginning and end of each sprint.

## üéØ Design Cohesion Framework

### Core Design Pillars

1.  **Fluid & Expressive Movement**: Player control is paramount, enabling skillful traversal, environmental interaction, and a sense of mastery.
2.  **Engaging & Dynamic Combat**: Combat is challenging yet fair, rewarding skill, strategic thinking, and offering diverse approaches through Aether abilities.
3.  **Deep Exploration & Discovery**: The fractured world of Aetheris is rich with secrets, hidden paths, and lore, encouraging curiosity and rewarding thoroughness.
4.  **Compelling Narrative Integration**: The story of Kael and the Great Fracture is interwoven with gameplay, with player choices and discoveries shaping their understanding and the world.
5.  **Consistent & Vibrant Stylized Aesthetic**: Visuals, audio, and UI/UX work in harmony to create a cohesive, immersive, and memorable cross-platform experience.

### Design Validation Checklist (Per Sprint/Major Feature)

(To be developed, but will include questions like)

- Does this feature align with our Core Design Pillars?
- Does it enhance the core gameplay loop (Explore, Combat, Progress)?
- Is it intuitive for the player?
- Does it maintain world consistency (Aetheris)?
- Does it contribute positively to the player's journey and Kael's development?

### Task Tracking Legend

- üü¢ **Ready**: Prerequisites met, can start immediately
- üü° **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
