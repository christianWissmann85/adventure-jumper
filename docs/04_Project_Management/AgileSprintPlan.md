# Adventure Jumper - Agile Sprint Plan

## üìã Document Overview

This document breaks down the Adventure Jumper development into granular, trackable tasks organized by sprint. Each sprint is divided into microversions with specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and dependencies. This plan is a living document and will be updated at the beginning and end of each sprint.

## üéØ Design Cohesion Framework

### Core Design Pillars

1.  **Fluid & Expressive Movement**: Player control is paramount, enabling skillful traversal, environmental interaction, and a sense of mastery.
2.  **Engaging & Dynamic Combat**: Combat is challenging yet fair, rewarding skill, strategic thinking, and offering diverse approaches through Aether abilities.
3.  **Deep Exploration & Discovery**: The fractured world of Aetheris is rich with secrets, hidden paths, and lore, encouraging curiosity and rewarding thoroughness.
4.  **Compelling Narrative Integration**: The story of Kael and the Great Fracture is interwoven with gameplay, with player choices and discoveries shaping their understanding and the world.
5.  **Consistent & Vibrant Stylized Aesthetic**: Visuals, audio, and UI/UX work in harmony to create a cohesive, immersive, and memorable cross-platform experience.

### Design Validation Checklist (Per Sprint/Major Feature)

(To be developed, but will include questions like)

- Does this feature align with our Core Design Pillars?
- Does it enhance the core gameplay loop (Explore, Combat, Progress)?
- Is it intuitive for the player?
- Does it maintain world consistency (Aetheris)?
- Does it contribute positively to the player's journey and Kael's development?

### Task Tracking Legend

- üü¢ **Ready**: Prerequisites met, can start immediately
- üü° **In Progress**: Currently being worked on

**Testing Tasks:**

- [x] **QA2.1**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive Sprint 2 feature testing.
  - **Effort**: 6 hours
  - **‚úÖ Completion Notes**: Successfully completed comprehensive physics and controller testing. All physics enhancement tests, player control tests, and physics/controller integration tests are now passing. Fixed critical physics system issues including ground state logic, gravity application, collision detection, controller input state management, movement direction changes, and jump buffering mechanisms. Validated physics improvements through rigorous testing with all 176 tests passing including previously failing asset loading tests. Physics system now correctly handles gravity when entities are on ground, friction-based stopping, collision with ground, and all controller input scenarios including key state changes, input state resets, and physics change translations. Jump buffering system properly handles players in air scenarios and executes buffered jumps when landing. **UPDATE (May 25, 2025)**: Asset loading test failures have been completely resolved - fixed SpriteLoader compilation issues, improved test environment detection in PlayerAnimator, corrected test file syntax errors, and replaced direct game.update() calls with proper tester.pump() async patterns. All end-to-end gameplay tests now pass successfully.

#### üèÜ Sprint Success Criteria

- Player can execute a single jump with physics-based movement (gravity, arc, landing) as defined in `PlayerCharacter.TDD.md` and `GravitySystem.TDD.md`.
- Platform collision, landing detection, and basic edge detection work reliably, preventing fall-throughs and enabling consistent ground state management.
- Player cannot perform multi-jumps (single jump only, respecting ground state and coyote time).
- Aether Shard collectibles can be placed, detected, and picked up by the player.
- `PlayerStats` accurately tracks Aether resource changes upon collectible pickup.
- The foundational `AetherComponent` correctly stores Aether-related parameters, and the `AetherSystem` can read/update these values based on external triggers (e.g., collectible pickup).
- Basic Aether HUD element displays the current Aether count from `PlayerStats` and updates in real-time.
- Placeholder animations for player states (idle, walk, jump, fall, land) are triggered correctly based on player actions and physics state.
- No critical physics bugs (e.g., consistent platform penetration, infinite jumping, incorrect gravity application) are present.
- The game maintains target 60fps performance with the new physics systems and collectibles active in the test environment.
- All new systems and components integrate correctly with the Sprint 1 architectural skeleton.
- Code quality is maintained, new features are documented (code comments, TDD updates), and align with established patterns.

#### üé® Design Cohesion Focus (Sprint 2)

- **Fluid & Expressive Movement**:
  - Implement core jump mechanics (variable height, jump cut-off, air control, coyote time) that feel responsive, controllable, and satisfying, laying the groundwork for more advanced traversal.
  - Ensure physics enhancements (gravity, friction, terminal velocity) contribute to a predictable and understandable movement feel.
- **Deep Exploration & Discovery**:
  - Introduce the first interactive element (Aether Shard collectible) that rewards player interaction and begins to populate the world with discoverable items.
  - Establish the Aether resource as a tangible element players can gather.
- **Compelling Narrative Integration**:
  - Build the foundational data structures for the Aether system (`PlayerStats`, `AetherComponent`, `AetherSystem`) which will be central to Kael's abilities and the world's lore.
- **Consistent & Vibrant Stylized Aesthetic**:
  - Ensure the basic Aether HUD element is clear, readable, and provides a first look at the game's UI style (even if using placeholder assets).
  - Placeholder collectible art and player animations should be distinct and functional, establishing the pipeline for future art integration.
