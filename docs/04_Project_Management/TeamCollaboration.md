## Overview

This document outlines the team collaboration practices for the Adventure Jumper project. It provides guidelines for effective teamwork, communication channels, decision-making processes, and conflict resolution strategies.

## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels

### Meeting Structure

1. **Daily Standups**
   - Time: 9:30 AM - 9:45 AM (15 minutes)
   - Format: Virtual via Zoom
   - Purpose: Quick status updates, blocker identification
   - Each member answers: What did I complete yesterday? What am I working on today? Any blockers?

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Time: First Monday of sprint, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM
   - Format: In-person or virtual via Zoom
   - Purpose: Define sprint goals, assign tasks, estimate effort
   - Outcome: Sprint backlog with assigned tasks

3. **Sprint Review**
   - Time: Last Friday of sprint, 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM
   - Format: In-person or virtual via Zoom
   - Purpose: Demo completed work, collect feedback
   - Outcome: Acceptance of completed features or feedback for improvements

4. **Sprint Retrospective**

   - Format: In-person or virtual via Zoom
   - Purpose: Reflect on the sprint, identify improvements
   - Outcome: Action items for process improvement

## Decision-Making Process

### Types of Decisions

1. **Technical Decisions**
   - Owner: Lead Developer
   - Process: RFC (Request for Comments) document shared with team
   - Timeline: 2-3 days for review and comments
   - Resolution: Lead Developer makes final decision after considering input

2. **Design Decisions**
   - Owner: Lead Designer
   - Process: Design proposals with alternatives presented to team
   - Timeline: 1 week for review and feedback
   - Resolution: Lead Designer makes final decision after feedback integration

3. **Project Management Decisions**
   - Owner: Project Manager
   - Process: Options presented in management meeting
   - Timeline: Decision made within the meeting or within 24 hours
   - Resolution: Project Manager decides based on project priorities

### Consensus Model

For major decisions affecting multiple disciplines, we follow a consensus-based approach:
1. Proposal presented to relevant stakeholders
2. Discussion period (typically 1-3 days)
3. Voting (if necessary)
4. Implementation of decision
5. Review after implementation

## Conflict Resolution

### Principles

1. **Focus on issues, not personalities**
2. **Seek to understand before being understood**
3. **Consider the project's best interests**
4. **Maintain respect and professionalism**

### Resolution Process

1. **Direct communication** - Parties involved discuss the issue privately
2. **Facilitated discussion** - If unresolved, request a neutral team member to facilitate
3. **Escalation** - If still unresolved, escalate to the project manager or team lead
4. **Final decision** - Project manager/lead makes a binding decision if consensus cannot be reached

## Remote Work Guidelines

### Core Hours
- 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM (local time) - All team members should be available during these hours
- Flexible time outside of core hours for focused work

### Availability
- Update Slack status to indicate availability
- Respond to direct messages within 2 hours during working hours
- Set up "Do Not Disturb" during focus time, but communicate this in advance

### Home Office Setup
- Minimum requirements: Reliable internet connection, webcam, headphones with microphone
- Recommended: Dual monitors, ergonomic chair, quiet workspace

## Team Norms

1. **Respect time boundaries** - Avoid contacting team members outside of working hours
2. **Camera on** for important meetings, optional for daily standups
3. **Share knowledge** through documentation, not just verbal communication
4. **Celebrate successes** and acknowledge team members' contributions
5. **No blame culture** - Focus on learning and improvement
6. **Be inclusive** - Consider different time zones, backgrounds, and work styles

## Inter-team Collaboration

### Coordination with Other Teams

| Team | Primary Contact | Coordination Mechanism | Frequency |
|------|----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Art | Art Director | Art sync meeting | Weekly |
| Audio | Audio Lead | Audio review session | Bi-weekly |
| Marketing | Marketing Manager | Status report | Monthly |
| QA | QA Lead | Testing hand-off meeting | End of sprint |

### Cross-functional Initiatives

For features requiring multiple disciplines:
1. Kick-off meeting with all involved teams
2. Weekly sync meetings during development
3. Shared documentation and progress tracking
4. Joint demo sessions for stakeholder feedback
