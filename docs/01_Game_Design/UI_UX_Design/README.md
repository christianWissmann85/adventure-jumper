# UI/UX Design Documentation

This directory contains detailed information about the user interface and user experience design for Adventure Jumper. The documentation follows our [UI/UX Style Guide](../../05_Style_Guides/UI_UX_Style.md) and connects with the technical implementation in [UI System TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/UISystem.TDD.md).

## Complete UI/UX Documentation Suite

- [Design Philosophy](DesignPhilosophy.md) - Core principles guiding our UI/UX design
- [Menus and Layouts](Menus_Layouts.md) - Design of menu screens and navigation
- [HUD Layouts](HUD_Layouts.md) - In-game heads-up display elements

## UI Design Goals

1. **Minimalist by Default**: Only show what is needed, when it's needed
2. **Diegetic Where Possible**: Integrate UI elements into the game world
3. **Responsive & Fluid**: Smooth transitions and feedback
4. **Consistent Visual Language**: Cohesive style throughout the experience

## Game System Integration

The UI/UX designs interact with these gameplay systems:
- [Combat System](../Mechanics/CombatSystem_Design.md) - Combat HUD elements
- [Aether System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/AetherSystem.TDD.md) - Displaying energy levels
- [Narrative Elements](../Narrative/00-story-outline.md) - Dialogue UI and story presentation

## Character and World Integration
- [Main Character](../Characters/01-main-character.md) - Character status and ability displays
- [World Navigation](../Worlds/00-World-Connections.md) - Map interfaces and world transition UI
- [NPC Interactions](../Characters/04-npcs.md) - Dialogue systems and character interactions

## Relationship to Technical Implementation

- [UI System TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/UISystem.TDD.md) - Technical architecture
- [UI Asset Management](../../02_Technical_Design/AssetPipeline.md) - UI asset workflow

## Style Guidelines

For style guidelines related to UI:
- [UI/UX Style Guide](../../05_Style_Guides/UI_UX_Style.md) - Visual design standards

## Responsible Team

The UI/UX Design documentation is primarily maintained by:
- UI/UX Designer

- Technical UI Developer

All UI/UX changes should be reviewed by both the Lead UI/UX Designer and Lead Developer to ensure design consistency and technical feasibility.
