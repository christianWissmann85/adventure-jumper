## The Shattered Realms
Aetheris was once a unified world of magic and technology, where ancient civilizations thrived in harmony. However, the Great Fracture tore the world into floating islands, each with its own unique environment and challenges. These fragments now drift in the endless sky, connected only by ancient teleportation gates and magical currents.

## The Energy Crisis
At the heart of Aetheris lies the Crystal Core, a massive source of magical energy that maintains the stability of the floating islands. Recently, the Core has begun to fail, causing islands to lose their magical buoyancy and crash into the abyss below. As a [Jumper](../Characters/01-main-character.md), you must traverse the realms to discover the cause of the Core's deterioration and prevent the complete collapse of Aetheris.

## Key Locations

The world of Aetheris is divided into distinct realms, each with unique characteristics:

### 1. The Floating Archipelago
- **[Luminara](../Worlds/01-luminara-hub.md)**: The central hub city, built around the Crystal Spire
- **[The Verdant Canopy](../Worlds/02-verdant-canopy.md)**: Lush forest islands with ancient ruins
- **[The Forge Peaks](../Worlds/03-forge-peaks.md)**: Volcanic islands with mechanical wonders
- **[The Celestial Archive](../Worlds/04-celestial-archive.md)**: Islands containing vast repositories of ancient knowledge
- **[The Void's Edge](../Worlds/05-voids-edge.md)**: Mysterious fractured islands on the boundary of the abyss

### 2. The Underworld
- The mysterious realm below the floating islands
- Home to shadow creatures and forgotten technology
- Source of the corruption affecting the Crystal Core
