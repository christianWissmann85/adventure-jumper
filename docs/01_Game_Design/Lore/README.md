This directory contains documentation about the overall world backstory, history, culture, and mythology of Adventure Jumper. These documents serve as the foundation for all narrative and environmental design decisions.

## Overview

## Technical Implementation

The lore elements influence the technical design in several ways:

### Gameplay Systems
- [Aether System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/AetherSystem.TDD.md) - Implementation of the world's magical energy
- [Gravity System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/GravitySystem.TDD.md) - Implementation of floating island physics

- [Environment System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/EnvironmentSystem.TDD.md) - Environmental storytelling

## Design Guidelines

When creating or modifying lore content:

1. **Consistency is Critical** - All new lore must align with established world rules
2. **Show Don't Tell** - Prefer environmental storytelling over exposition
3. **Mystery Maintenance** - Some elements should remain mysterious to preserve wonder
4. **Gameplay Integration** - Lore should enhance, not obstruct, gameplay experiences

## Responsible Team

The Lore & Worldbuilding documentation is primarily maintained by:
- Lead Narrative Designer
- World Design Team
- Art Direction Team (for visual lore elements)

All changes should be reviewed by the Lead Narrative Designer to ensure consistency with the established world rules and narrative vision.
