## Progression Path

### 1. Luminara (Hub World)
- **Main Quest**: "Awakening"
- **Unlocks**: Basic movement (jump, dash)
- **Connection Method**: Aether Gates (unlocked after tutorial)
- **Key Item**: Aether Compass (shows available paths)

### 2. Verdant Canopy (First Zone)
- **Main Quest**: "Roots of the Past"
- **Unlocks**: Wall Jump
- **Connection Method**: Great Tree's roots extend to other zones
- **Puzzle Type**: Environmental manipulation (growing vines, redirecting water)
- **To Forge Peaks**: Ancient root system through the Undercanopy

### 3. Forge Peaks (Second Zone)
- **Main Quest**: "Heart of the Mountain"
- **Unlocks**: Heat Resistance
- **Connection Method**: Magma Tubes
- **Puzzle Type**: Heat-based mechanisms, weight puzzles
- **To Celestial Archive**: Dwarven Sky Cannon (requires cooling system fixed)

### 4. Celestial Archive (Third Zone)
- **Main Quest**: "Tomes of Destiny"
- **Unlocks**: Time Pulse (slow time briefly)
- **Connection Method**: Reality Tears
- **Puzzle Type**: Time-based, perspective shifts
- **To Void's Edge**: Forbidden Section (requires all knowledge fragments)

### 5. Void's Edge (Final Zone)
- **Main Quest**: "Edge of Reality"
- **Unlocks**: Reality Anchor
- **Connection Method**: None (one-way trip)
- **Puzzle Type**: Reality manipulation, perspective puzzles

## World Connections

### Aether Currents
- **Function**: Natural pathways between worlds
- **Visual**: Glowing blue streams in the sky
- **Gameplay**: Can be ridden like rivers in the sky

### Ancient Gates
- **Location**: Each major zone has one
- **Activation**: Requires Aether Shards
- **Effect**: Fast travel between activated gates

### The World Tree's Roots
- **Connects**: All natural zones
- **Access Points**: Hidden hollows marked by bioluminescent fungi
- **Mechanics**: Some roots are too small initially, grow over time with player progress

### Mechanical Lifts
- **Connects**: Forge Peaks to upper areas and Celestial Archive
- **Mechanics**: Require steam power and gear repairs
- **Lore**: Built by ancient dwarven engineers to access the sky temples

### Reality Tears
- **Location**: Primarily in the Celestial Archive, but appearing more frequently near Void's Edge
- **Danger**: Unstable tears can damage the player or transport them to dangerous areas
- **Mechanics**: Using the Aether Lens reveals hidden tears and stabilizes them for transit

## Travel Limitations

### Initial Constraints
- Most paths between zones are initially closed or dangerous
- Players must follow the critical path until they gain key abilities

### Mid-Game Freedom
- After acquiring the Aether Lens, players can revisit most previous areas
- Teleportation between Ancient Gates becomes possible

### Backtracking Incentives
- Hidden areas that require abilities from later zones
- Collectibles for completionists
- Optional boss encounters

## Zone Transition Design

### Visual Transitions
- Each zone boundary features a distinctive "threshold" area
- Environmental effects gradually blend between zones
- Music crossfades between zone themes

### Gameplay Transitions
- Brief traversal challenges mark the borders between zones
- These serve as natural difficulty gates
- Narrative events often occur at zone transitions

## Technical Implementation

The world connections are implemented through:
- [Level Management System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/LevelManagement.TDD.md) - World transition handling
- [Loading System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/LoadingSystem.TDD.md) - Seamless world loading
- [Navigation System](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/NavigationSystem.TDD.md) - World traversal mechanics

## Design Considerations

### Pacing Control
- World connections are designed to guide the player's progress without feeling restrictive
- Natural barriers and narrative gates create a sense of earned progression
- Shortcuts unlock as the player gains new abilities, encouraging exploration

### Visual Language
- Each connection type has a distinctive visual style for player recognition
- Color coding helps players identify which connections lead to which worlds
- Environmental storytelling hints at connections before they are explicitly revealed

### Player Experience Goals
- Discovery: Finding new paths should feel rewarding
- Mastery: Learning to navigate efficiently between worlds
- Continuity: World transitions maintain narrative and gameplay flow
