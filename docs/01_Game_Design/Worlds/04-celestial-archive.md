# The Celestial Archive

*This document describes the Celestial Archive world in Adventure Jumper. For connections to other worlds, see [World Connections](00-World-Connections.md). For technical implementation, see [LevelManagement.TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/LevelManagement.TDD.md).*

## Overview
A massive floating library that drifts between dimensions, containing knowledge from across time and space. The Archive is tended by the enigmatic Curators, beings who exist outside normal time. Here, the very fabric of reality is thin, and the laws of physics are more like suggestions.

## Visual Theme
- **Primary Colors**: Deep purples, starry blues, and gold accents
- **Architecture**: Impossible geometries, floating bookshelves, shifting corridors
- **Lighting**: Soft starlight, floating candles, glowing runes
- **Atmosphere**: Quiet with a sense of weightlessness, pages constantly drifting through the air

- **Enemies**: Animated Tomes, Knowledge Seekers

### 2. The Chronology Wing
- **Purpose**: Records of historical events
- **Features**:
  - Time-locked sections
  - Self-updating history books
  - Forbidden future archives
- **Key NPCs**: Timekeeper Curators
- **Enemies**: Temporal Anomalies, [Archivist Spectre](../Characters/03-enemies.md#2-archivist-spectre)

### 3. The Reflection Chambers
- **Purpose**: Study of alternate realities
- **Features**:
  - Mirrors showing possible futures
  - Echoes of other versions of Kael
  - Reality-warping puzzles
- **Key NPCs**: Mirror Guides
- **Enemies**: Shadow Reflections, [The Living Codex](../Characters/03-enemies.md#2-the-living-codex)

## Gameplay Elements

### Platforming Challenges
1. **Shifting Bookshelves**
   - Rearrange themselves when not observed
   - Create new paths when aligned
   - Some contain hidden compartments
   - *Technical implementation: [LevelManagement.TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/LevelManagement.TDD.md)*

2. **Gravity Wells**
   - Change the direction of gravity
   - Walk on walls and ceilings
   - Solve spatial puzzles
   - *Technical implementation: [GravitySystem.TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/GravitySystem.TDD.md)*

3. **Echo Platforms**
   - Only exist in certain time periods
   - Flicker in and out of existence
   - Can be stabilized with Aether energy
   - *Technical implementation: [TimeManipulation.TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/TimeManipulation.TDD.md)*

### Puzzles
1. **Temporal Puzzles**
   - Interact with objects across different time periods
   - Observe cause and effect across timelines
   - Create stable time loops to progress

2. **Knowledge Puzzles**
   - Collect specific information from books
   - Arrange knowledge fragments to unlock doors
   - Discover hidden meanings in ancient texts

3. **Reality Puzzles**
   - Shift between parallel dimensions
   - Match patterns across realities
   - Create paradoxes to unlock secrets

### Unique Mechanics
- **Time Dilation**: Slow down or speed up time in limited areas
- **Reality Shifting**: Toggle between alternate versions of rooms
- **Knowledge Absorption**: Collect and use information as a resource

## Story Elements

### Narrative Arc
