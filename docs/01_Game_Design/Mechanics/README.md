# Mechanics Design Documentation
*Last Updated: May 23, 2025*

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for Adventure Jumper's gameplay mechanics, covering core systems, player interactions, and world integration.

## Core Gameplay Systems

### Primary Mechanics
- **[Core Gameplay Loop](CoreGameplayLoop.md)** - Fundamental player interaction cycle
- **Combat System Design** - Combat mechanics and encounter design *(Coming Soon)*
- **Aether System Design** - Energy-based ability system *(Coming Soon)*
- **Movement System Design** - Platforming and traversal mechanics *(Coming Soon)*

## Integration with Game Elements

### Character Integration
- **[Player Character](../Characters/01-main-character.md)** - How mechanics apply to Kael's abilities
- **[Enemy Design](../Characters/03-enemies.md)** - Mechanical influence on enemy behavior
- **[Ally Systems](../Characters/02-allies.md)** - Companion ability integration

### World Integration  
- **[World Connections](../Worlds/00-World-Connections.md)** - Mechanics variations between environments
- **[Puzzle Mechanics](../Worlds/06-puzzles-mechanics.md)** - Environment-specific challenges
- **[World-Specific Systems](../Worlds/)** - Heat, time, and reality manipulation mechanics

### Progression Systems
- **[Character Development](../Characters/01-main-character.md#character-progression)** - Ability and skill advancement
- **[User Experience](../UI_UX_Design/README.md)** - Player communication and onboarding

## Relationship to Technical Implementation

- [Enemy AI TDD](../../02_Technical_Design/TDD/EnemyAI.TDD.md)

## Design Principles

The mechanics of Adventure Jumper follow these core design principles:
1. **Fluid Movement** - Controls should feel responsive and empowering
2. **Consistent Rules** - Core mechanics maintain consistency across all worlds
3. **Progressive Complexity** - New mechanics build upon established foundations
4. **Readable Feedback** - Player actions have clear, immediate visual and audio feedback
5. **Meaningful Choices** - Resource management creates interesting decisions

## Responsible Team

The Mechanics Design documentation is primarily maintained by:
- Game Design Team
- Combat Designer
- Systems Designer
- Level Design Team
