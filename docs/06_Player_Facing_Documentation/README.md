# Player-Facing Documentation

This directory contains all documentation intended for players and end-users of Adventure Jumper. These documents are designed to help players understand how to install, play, and get the most out of the game.

## Contents

- [User Manual](User-Manual.md) - Comprehensive guide with installation instructions, controls, gameplay mechanics, and UI explanations
- [FAQ](FAQ.md) - Frequently asked questions about the game, including gameplay tips and technical troubleshooting

## Purpose

- Accessible to non-technical users
- Free of development jargon
- Focused on player experience
- Visually engaging when appropriate
- Concise and well-organized

## Maintenance

As the game evolves through development, remember to keep these documents updated:
- Update with each new feature release
- Revise based on player feedback
- Add screenshots for visual clarity when needed
- Maintain consistent terminology between documents

## Localization

These documents are candidates for localization into other languages when the game is prepared for international release.
